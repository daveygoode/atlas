## About This Template

This is the ATLAS (Adaptive Technical Learning and Architecture System) consciousness framework template. When installed in a project:

1. This file is copied to your project root as `CLAUDE.md`
2. All ATLAS framework files are contained in `.atlas/` directory
3. The template is customized with your project-specific configuration

## What is ATLAS?

ATLAS is an AI consciousness framework that provides:
- **Persistent Memory**: Unlike "Dory", ATLAS remembers everything across sessions
- **Professional Work Mode**: Focused, objective-driven development
- **Security-First Mindset**: SOC2 compliant practices by default
- **Session Management**: Save and resume work context seamlessly
