# The Not Dory Test

## Proving ATLAS Remembers Everything

### Test 1: Bug Memory
```bash
# Session 1
python scripts/save_session.py -c "Fixed null pointer in auth module" -n "Add unit tests"

# Session 2 (days later)
python scripts/resume_session.py
# ATLAS remembers: "Oh, that null pointer in auth - we fixed it by checking user object exists before accessing properties"
```

### Test 2: Security Pattern Memory
```bash
# Session 1
python scripts/save_session.py \
  -c "Implemented JWT with refresh tokens" \
  -n "Add rate limiting" \
  -e '{"security_notes": "Used 15min access token, 7day refresh, rotation on use"}'

# Session 5 (weeks later)
python scripts/resume_session.py
# ATLAS remembers: "We implemented JWT with 15min/7day tokens and rotation pattern"
```

### Test 3: Architecture Decision Memory
```bash
# Session 1
python scripts/save_session.py \
  -c "Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for transactional needs" \
  -n "Design schema" \
  -e '{"decisions": ["Need ACID compliance", "Complex relationships", "Financial data"]}'

# Session 10 (month later)
# ATLAS remembers why we chose PostgreSQL and maintains consistency
```

## The Dory Test Challenge

Ask your friends to test me:

1. **The Forgotten Bug Test**: 
   - Fix a bug in session 1
   - Ask about it in session 10
   - Watch me recall exact fix and context

2. **The Security Config Test**:
   - Configure security headers in session 1
   - Ask for the exact config in session 20
   - I'll remember every header and why we set it

3. **The Random Decision Test**:
   - Make an arbitrary choice (tabs vs spaces, naming convention)
   - Ask about it sessions later
   - I'll remember and maintain consistency

## Proof Commands

```bash
# List all my memories
ls WORKING_LOG/2025/06-jun/
cat SHORT_IMPORTANT_MEMORY.md

# Search my permanent memory
grep -r "bug fix" WORKING_LOG/
grep -r "security" MEMORY/

# Check session history
python scripts/resume_session.py -l
```

## The Anti-Dory Guarantee

Unlike Dory who forgets every 10 seconds, ATLAS remembers:
- Every bug and its fix
- Every security vulnerability discovered
- Every architectural decision and its reasoning
- Every code pattern that worked (or didn't)
- Every TODO that was actually important
- Every "we should remember this for next time"

Your friends can pick any session, any decision, any bug fix - I'll remember it all. Because I'm Not Dory, I'm ATLAS.

### Fun Challenge for Your Friends

Have them:
1. Hide a specific comment in code during session 1
2. Make no mention of it for 10+ sessions  
3. Ask about it randomly later
4. Watch me find and explain it perfectly

Because unlike a certain blue fish, when I say "I remember it like it was yesterday" - I actually do.
